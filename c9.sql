Longer steep times will enhance the licorice notes.\n\n* Note: Every 2 ounces (oz.) of tea can brew approximately 20 cups.

If drinking this tea is wrong, then you''ll never want to be right.\n\nSteep for 5-7 minutes.

Simple things always stay classic.\n\nOur Earl Grey stays true to the classic traditional blend of Chinese black tea flavored with bergamot for its signature full-bodied citrus taste. Want to spin a classic? Try with milk and sugar.\n\nSteep for 3-5 minutes. Longer steep times increase the tea''s acidity (great for adding milk and sugar).\n\n* Note: Every 2 ounces (oz.) of tea can brew approximately 20 cups.

(100006, 'CEREMONIAL GRADE MATCHA POWDER', 'If you''re looking for more ways to incorporate green tea into your lifestyle, try matcha powder. Our matcha powder is ceremonial grade, meaning it is made from shade-grown green tea leaves harvested early in the spring and then stone-ground to a fine powder. So you can expect it to be bright green in color, and have more intense sweetness and deeper flavor than standard or courser grades harvested later in the year.\n\nPreparing matcha in the ancient Japanese tradition is veiled in detailed ritual and ceremony, but don''t let that stop you from trying it at home. You''ll reap more health benefits from matcha than you do from other teas because you''re ingesting the whole leaf rather than discarding it after steeping.\n\nAt its core matcha is really quite simple to prepare if you have a matcha set: place 1-2 tsp of matcha powder into the matcha bowl and pour in approximately 2-3 oz of not-quite-boiling water.  Wisk it rapidly until the powdered tea is completely dissolved.\n\nCeremonial grade matcha is meant to be savored as a standalone beverage without sugar or milk (unlike "culinary" or "restaurant grade" matcha), but we will admit it makes a pretty fantastic latte with milk and sugar.\n\nThese simple instructions will get you started, but enhancing your technique and style can make for a lifelong project (invite us over when you''ve perfected it!)', 'Matcha_Loose_large.jpg', 1, 28),
